I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

I'm experimenting with FastAPI.

For documentation run the program and go to 127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Click on run.bat to run the program.

Tested working with [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/).<br/>
For use with Redis Cloud replace lines 34-38 with information provided by Redis.

Best Regards,<br/>
Brian
